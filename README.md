# Deep Learning – Skin Cancer Classification  

Project developed in the Master’s in Data Science at Polytechnic of Leiria (2024/2025), for the course *Deep Learning*.  

## Objective  
Train and compare convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the classification of skin cancer images using the HAM10000 dataset.  

## Main Tasks  
- Dataset preparation with train, validation, and test sets.  
- Develop **Model S**: CNN architecture built from scratch.  
- Apply different optimizers, loss functions, and regularization techniques.  
- Use **data augmentation** to improve generalization.  
- Develop **Model T**: Transfer learning with feature extraction and fine-tuning.  
- Evaluate models with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Results  
- Model S achieved up to **70% F1-score** after optimization with Optuna.  
- Model T (transfer learning) reached a **73% F1-score**, showing better performance.
